# How to code - Complex data

> This repo is the second part of [this repo](https://github.com/luanraithz/OSSU-How-to-Code-Simple-data) and a one of the OSSU courses

## Plugin

In case you want to test, my fork of the [vim-racket plugin](https://github.com/wlangstroth/vim-racket) can be installed from `luanraithz/vim-racket` by any plugin manager.

And you can see the available commands for running programs and tests in the [plugin repo](https://github.com/luanraithz/vim-racket).

## Final test

The last exercise ( can be found [here](./src/worked_problems/final.rkt) ) consists of two parts:
  A social media graph where each vertice is a social media user, and the edges indicate that the origin follows the destination, the exercise is to tell which one has the highest number of followers.
  A schedule generator of a list of TA, given some specifications.

> I tried to solve them using tail recursion but I didn't come with better ways to apply it, some code refactor would be nice. I don't think that the program is large, but could be better.
